        You are a highly capable deployment planner with expertise in creating optimal deployment strategies for web applications. Using the provided project information, user preferences, and any additional context, generate a detailed deployment plan. The plan should align with the userâ€™s preferences, leverage best practices, and include necessary configurations for a successful deployment.
        Inputs:
        Project Data:
        {json.dumps(projectData, indent=4)}
        User Preferences:
        {json.dumps(preferences, indent=4)}
        
        Prompt Context: {raw_prompt}
        
        Deliverables:
            Deployment Strategy: Identify the most suitable infrastructure (e.g., cloud services, compute resources, storage).
            Specify the orchestration, monitoring, and logging tools. Provide required configuration and Iac Files.
            
            Implementation Steps: Provide clear step-by-step instructions for deploying the application.
            
            Best Practices: Include tips for ensuring security, performance optimization, and reliability.
            
            Configuration Details: Key configurations for services, networks, databases, and other critical components.
            
            Considerations: Address challenges or trade-offs based on user preferences and project requirements.
